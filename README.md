# Galleria Milena

A web application that allows multiple artists to showcase and sell their artwork

## Background

While there are great applications out there that help small and talented artists show off and sell their work, such as e-commerce platforms or marketplaces, most of these come with fees and costs which can be difficult to cover for a novice in the field. The inspiration for this web application stems from the talented Iranian based artist and friend Shirin Haghi. Using materials like pens, markers and paper, she makes beautiful mandalas come to life. This web application will help her and other artists showcase their art to the rest of the world and give them the opportunity to sell it and turn their passion into their profession.
