You can also view all the orders you have in place and send order updates directly to your customerâ€™s inbox using the Twilio SendGrid API. As a customer, you can view all of the artists galleries and purchase a variety items from multiple artists in one transaction.

## Background

While there are great applications out there that help small and talented artists show off and sell their work, such as e-commerce platforms or marketplaces, most of these come with fees and costs which can be difficult to cover for a novice in the field. The inspiration for this web application stems from the talented Iranian based artist and friend Shirin Haghi. Using materials like pens, markers and paper, she makes beautiful mandalas come to life. This web application will help her and other artists showcase their art to the rest of the world and give them the opportunity to sell it and turn their passion into their profession.
